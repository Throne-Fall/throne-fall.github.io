		<hr class="pageTitleUnderline">
				
		<p>In Thronefall you level up by playing the game and earning points, which are calculated using the following equation:</p>
		<p><span class="codeBlock">[base score + (gold amount × 10)] × 1.2<sup>(mutator amount)</sup></span></p>
		<p>By surpassing certain scores you level up and get new perks, weapons, upgrades or even permanent upgrades.</p>
