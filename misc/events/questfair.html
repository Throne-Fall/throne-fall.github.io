        <p>Every couple of months, the developers host an official Thronefall tournament! Players can participate on the official <a href="https://discord.gg/gVYctptyg8">Thronefall discord server</a>.</p>
        <p>QuestFair was the second official tournament that has been hosted. The developers promised some event that were not about highscore-hunting and so they delivered QuestFair! The goal of the challenge was to create the most creative Quest, while not inventing new gameplay mechanics.</p>
        <p>The start of the event was the 22nd December 2023 and it ended on the 5th January 2024.</p>

        <h3>🎖️ matan - No Preparation, go go go!</h3>
        <hr />
        <h4>Quest:</h4>
        <p>Complete a level with less than 15 secs of preparations timer between waves</p>
        <h4>Devevelopers' Comment:</h4>
        <p><em>This post received the most community upvotes by a long margin so how could we say no. The idea didn&rsquo;t cross our mind before and it sure does sound like a fun new way to play Thronefall. We&rsquo;ll think about where to best implement that into the game and give it a go go go!</em></p>
        <h3>🎖️ Gertimoshka - I like just the way they are</h3>
        <hr />
        <h4>Quest:</h4>
        <p>Never move any of your own units from their starting positions.</p>
        <h4>Devevelopers' Comment:</h4>
        <p><em>Both we as well as the community liked the idea. We&rsquo;ll find a way to put it into the game, probably as a mutator so you can&rsquo;t accidentally move your units and mess up the quest.</em></p>
        <h3>🎖️ CaporalNico - The great Wall</h3>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Quest:</strong></p>
        <p>Before Night 3 build a wall or two they can protect your castle and don't lose it a single part of your wall</p>
        <h4>Devevelopers' Comment:</h4>
        <p><em>The idea of having to protect something specific came up a few times but protecting your walls seems like the most fun and intuitive twist on the idea. We&rsquo;re not sure how well it would work as a quest (the rules don&rsquo;t quite fit into the quests section), but we have some ideas and will find a way to make it work. Nice one.</em></p>
        <h3>🎖️ Hjorse Rider - One Man Army</h3>
        <hr />
        <h4>Quest:</h4>
        <p>Thematically, you're a one man army who wins whichever battle you participate in.</p>
        <h4>Devevelopers' Comment:</h4>
        <p><em>This concept or idea came up multiple times in different variations. In Hjorse Rider&rsquo;s version building towers would still be allowed but building units would not be. In other variants e.g. by FlediX2 you may only build and upgrade your castle center and nothing else. Hjorse Rider gets the win in this category for choosing the best name One Man Army '' and for receiving the most community upvotes. That being said, we find all of these options interesting and will likely explore different variations of this idea in the game.</em></p>
