		    <hr>
		    <p>The Shadow In The Water is a boss enemy in Thronefall. They are encountered in the colder regions of the kingdom of Thronefall. While referred to as "Shadow In The Water" in-game, the name given by the developers is "Eismoloch" (german for "Ice Juggernaut").</p>
		    <p>Unlike all the other enemies in Thronefall, the Shadow In The Water spawns units instead of dealing damage directly. It takes damage everytime it does so and dealing additional damage to the boss reduces the amount of enemies it can spawn.</p>
		    <br>
		    <h2 class="pageSubtitle">Attack Pattern</h2>
		    <hr>
		    <p>Upon spawning, the boss instantly destroys the 2 fishing harbours (and their fishing ships), that are on the lake in the middle of the map.</p><br>
		    <p>The Shadow In The Water has 5 location where it spawns enemies. All these locations are at the edge of the lake in the middle of the map: 1. south-east, 2. south-west, 3. north-east, 4. north-west, 5. north. It starts spawning enemies in the south-east and changes its location everytime the healthbar depletes. In total, it spawns units in every location twice in the following pattern: </p>
		    <p> 1. south-east, 2. south-west, 3. south-east, 4. south-west, 5. north-east, 6. north-west, 7. north, 8. north-east, 9. north-west, 10. north</p>
