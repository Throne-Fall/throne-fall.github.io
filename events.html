		<p><em></em>12 New Mini Modes, Quality of Life & Bug Fixes</em></p>

		<p>This update brings <strong>12 new mini-modes</strong>, such as the long awaited <strong>True Endless</strong> mode where you go up against an (almost) endless amount of waves on just one map or the <strong>Reverse Siege</strong> mode where you are the attacker.</p>

		<p>There are new <strong>quality of life features</strong>, such as a game-speed hotkey, automatic detection of controller versus keyboard controls, support for some additional controller devices, bug fixes and color-blindness settings.</p>

		<p>We also added support for <strong>4 new languages</strong>: Korean, Italian, Ukrainian and Czech!</p>

		<p>This officially wraps up the content for Thronefall, but we'll of course continue to be here for urgent fixes if necessary. As always, thanks for the love and support. We hope you enjoy! üôå</p>

			we received a stream of very constructive criticism after last week's update. It was unclear how much the new modes were meant to be part of the main progression and whether it was mandatory to play them, and some were also balanced quite harshly. 
				<br> First and foremost we want to apologize for this suboptimal experience. Thank you for providing us with so much thoughtful feedback! We understand your concerns and tried to address your points in this update. You can read all about it over here:
