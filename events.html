		<p><strong>Dear Queens and Kings,</strong><br>
			we received a stream of very constructive criticism after last week's update. It was unclear how much the new modes were meant to be part of the main progression and whether it was mandatory to play them, and some were also balanced quite harshly. 
				<br> First and foremost we want to apologize for this suboptimal experience. Thank you for providing us with so much thoughtful feedback! We understand your concerns and tried to address your points in this update. You can read all about it over here:

		<h5 class="updateTitle">Version 1.5</h5>
		<h6 class="updateSubtitle">20th March 2024</h6>
		<hr class="updateArticleTitleHr">
			<p>Huge balancing update with many changes and reworks.</p>
			<p><strong>TOWERS REWORK:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Defense towers have brand new and reworked level 2 and level 3 upgrades.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>ETERNAL TRIALS - SEASON 2:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Complete rebalancing of the eternal trials wave generator and a fresh start with an empty highscore table.</li>
				<li>More difficult, new enemy preview, less random, more predictable, unwanted perks can be disabled.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>QUALITY OF LIFE:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>New unit control hotkeys, opening up huge micro potential and saving you tons of time during the day</li>
				<li>New command hotkey that selects / places only one unit type at a time (allows for easy sorting of clumped up units)</li>
				<li>Snappier keyboard controls and mouse movement added as a control option.</li>
				<li>Next day gold preview in the pause menu</li>
				<li>Tower range indicators</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>BALANCING:</strong></p>
			<p>Almost every perk and castle center upgrade has been touched in some shape or form. Some highlights:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your berserks have a brand new jump attack and your flails have health steal.</li>
				<li>Self-healing is a separate value now and no longer scales with your max health pool.</li>
				<li>Quick slings have to stop firing to reload.</li>
				<li>Mill upgrades are more powerful.</li>
				<li>Way more than we can even list here...</li>
			</ul>
